                Adventure sports or extreme sports are activities undertaken through the medium of Land, Water and Air and perceived as involving a high degree of risk. These activities often involve speed, height,
                 a high level of physical exertion and highly specialized gear.

                “Crashing is part of cycling as crying is part of love.” —
                Biking as a sport officially began on May 31, 1868, with a 1,200-metre (1,312-yard) race between the fountains and the entrance of Saint-Cloud Park (near Paris). The winner was James Moore, an 18-year-old expatriate Englishman from Paris. On November 7, 1869, the first city-to-city race was held between Paris and Rouen; again Moore was the winner, having covered the 135 km (84 miles) in 10 hours 25 minutes, including time spent walking his bicycle up the steeper hills. While road racing became common within a few years in continental Europe, in England the deteriorated conditions of the roads made them unsuitable, 
                and therefore the sport there focused on the track or time trials.

                “Paragliding is not just a sport, it’s a way of life.”-
                In 1966, Canadian Domina Jalbert was granted a patent for a multi-cell wing type aerial device—"a wing having a flexible canopy constituting an upper skin and with a plurality of longitudinally extending ribs forming in effect a wing corresponding to an airplane wing airfoil ... More particularly the invention contemplates the provision of a wing of rectangular or other shape having a canopy or top skin and a lower spaced apart bottom skin", a governable gliding parachute with multi-cells and
                 controls for glide.

                "Surfing is almost a way to fly"-
                Surfing is a surface water sport in which an individual, a surfer (or two in tandem surfing), uses a board to ride on
                 the forward section, or face, of a moving wave of water, which usually carries the surfer towards the shore. 
                 Waves suitable for surfing are primarily found on ocean shores, but can also be found in standing waves in the open ocean, in lakes, in rivers in the form 
                 of a tidal bore, or in wave pools.
